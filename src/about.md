I have over nine years of experience providing scientifically accurate explanatory illustrations and animations for physics, engineering, chemistry, and other natural science topics.

Inform Studio is my design studio specializing in scientific communication. We can provide:

- Scientific/technical diagrams and schematics
- Non-technical explanatory illustrations for the general public
- 2D and 3D scientific explanatory animations/visualizations
- Preparation of scientific figures for journal articles
- Journal covers
- Poster design
- Presentation design
- Consulting on visual communication techniques and strategy

In the past, weâ€™ve worked with:

- The National Institute of Standards and Technologies
