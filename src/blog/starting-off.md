I've wanted to keep a casual blog for a while, and have finally gotten around to adding it to my portfolio site. May create a stand-alone one eventually, but this will do for now.

My goals are keeping a work-related journal, logging interesting techniques and tips for graphics work, and possibly writing about animation, scientific illustration, and other graphics/design-related topics that interest me.
