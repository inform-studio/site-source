description: "As Jun (Kelly) Liu, Molecular Biology and Genetics, and her lab watch particular cells differentiate, they ask many questions: 'In humans and other mammals, the mesoderm [derived from cells born post-embryonically] produces the heart, bones, blood, and muscles. So the question is, what’s so special about the precursor cell that has the potential to produce all these different types of mesoderm cells? What’s involved in regulating how it divides? Why do some of its progeny differentiate into one cell type, while some others differentiate into another cell type?'"
