description: "Quantum gravity is one of the most intriguing and longstanding mysteries of the universe. Why is it important? At Cornell University, Thomas Hartman points to understanding the constituents of matter, their interactions, and the role gravity plays. 'We understand the problem of weakly interacting constituents of matter. That’s when particles only occasionally collide with each other and interact. But with strongly interacting matter, the particles interact so much, you end up with a soup of quantum stuff. You can’t even talk about individual particles anymore,' he says."
