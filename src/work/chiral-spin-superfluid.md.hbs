description: "The spontaneous chiral spin superfluid. When ultracold atomic spins are loaded into a hexagonal lattice, chiral spin currents are expected to develop. Here, the orange represents spin-up particles, and green spin-down. Arrows are used to guide the eye along the path of movement."

Looking over this again (Aug 2019), the honeycomb lattice inset in the top should not be squashed like that...kicking myself over that one. Also, not entirely sure what I was thinking with this color scheme. Painful.
