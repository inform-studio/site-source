title: "Identifying algae blooms through hyperspectral imaging"
date: 2016-08-26
client: "NIST"
description: "A team of NIST PML researchers is developing methods to identify harmful algae blooms remotely, using hyperspectral cameras. Unlike ordinary cameras, which record information in each of three broad color bands – red, green, and blue – hyperspectral imagers provide a full spectrum for each pixel in an image, recording data in dozens or hundreds of different narrow wavelength bands. NIST researchers are currently studying the harmful algae to create a 'reference spectrum,' which can be used to differentiate it from benign algae blooms."
