description: "To create electric charges in silicon, researchers shine pulsed laser light onto a sample. One-photon tests using visible light only penetrate a tiny way into a silicon sample â€” on the order of micrometers (millionths of a meter) or smaller. But the new two-photon tests using near infrared light penetrate much, much deeper into silicon, on the order of millimeters (thousandths of a meter) or longer. The one-photon tests create a lot of electric charge (shown here as pluses and minuses) in a relatively small volume. By contrast, the two-photon test creates far fewer electric charges in a much larger volume."
