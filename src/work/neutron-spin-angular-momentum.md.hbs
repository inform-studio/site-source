title: "Controlling neutron spin and orbital angular momentum"
date: 2019-10-29
client: "NIST"
description: "A New Twist: NIST researchers and their collaborators have produced a neutron beam in which two properties -- spin and orbital angular momentum -- are controlled simultaneously. This animation illustrates how the manipulated neutron beam behaves. The work may benefit the biomedical industry, giving researchers new tools to examine the structure of DNA for example."
