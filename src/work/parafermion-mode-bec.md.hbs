description: "A Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) forms inside a quasi-one-dimensional trench amid a two-dimensional gas of ultracold atoms. These atoms had already been put into a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state. The trench acts as a defect where two quasi-particles (area indicated here with two large glass spheres) can be snagged. This pair of quasi-particles together constitute a 'para-fermion' and might serve as a handy qubit."
alt: "Two spheres (the parafermion) sit on either side of a short trench containing a cloud of atoms."
