description: "A tiny magnetic rod is placed over a strip of magnetic film. This nanorod has a particular magnetic orientation, and a fringe field that interacts with the film, creating a bubble-shaped area where the direction of magnetism is reversed. By applying a second magnetic field, researchers can change the magnetic orientation of the nanorod, causing the magnetic bubble to shift from one end of the rod to the other. Measuring the location of the bubble can give scientists insight into the geometry and magnetic properties of the nanorod, and reveal if it is alone or clustered with other nanoparticles."
