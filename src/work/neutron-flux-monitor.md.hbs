description: "Illustration of the four-stage process developed by NIST for measuring neutron flux. From left to right, starting in the top corner: Step 1 – An extremely well characterized radiation source is placed in the alpha-gamma device. Step 2 – A controlled beam of neutrons passes through the device, striking a thin target. Step 3 – The thin target is replaced by a thick target that absorbs all incident neutrons. Step 4 – The flux-rate measurements are used to calibrate a portable monitor."
