The final deliverables for this project were a series of gifs. The first was a phonon in a 1D hexagonal lattice:

The second is a magnon, or spin wave, in the same 1D hexagonal lattice:

The final is a closeup of the magnon in a single cell of the lattice, showing the phase difference between the spins:
