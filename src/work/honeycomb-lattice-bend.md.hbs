description: "Close-up visualization of a “honeycomb” (hexagonal) lattice potential. Potentials of this kind are found in the band structure of graphene, a two-dimensional crystal of tightly-packed carbon atoms, and contribute to its unique electronic properties — electrons moving through graphene’s honeycomb lattice have no effective mass!"
