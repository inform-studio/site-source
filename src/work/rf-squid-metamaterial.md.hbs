description: "Illustration of a new self-cloaking metamaterial developed by University of Maryland physicists. An array of miniature devices (circular structures) called rf-SQUIDs can become transparent to microwave radiation with the flip of a switch. At left, the material is in transparent mode and allows microwaves to travel freely. At right, the material is in opaque mode and prevents microwaves from traversing the barrier."
